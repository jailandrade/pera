Wireframing is an important tool for product design and development.

Wireframes are typically created in the product design and development process in one way or another, even if it's a quick sketch on scratch paper.

## Whoe uses wireframes?

Any involved in the product in any capacity.

## Why should anyone use wireframes?

Wireframes are the blueprint for design. 

They're supposed to connect the underlying conceptual structure (or information architecture) to the surface (or visual design) of a website or mobile app. More specifically they're visual representations of an interface, used to communicate the following details to get everyone on the same page:

* Structure: How will the pieces of this site be put together?
* Content: What will be displaed on the site?
* Information hierarchy: How is this information organized and displayed?
* Functionality: How will this interface work?
* Behavior: How does it interact with the user? And how dos it behave?

Wireframes are not supposed to represent the visual design, contact graphic elements or convey the brand or identity.

## Why should I use wireframes?

You can use them to show user flows between views or pages. Also you can use wireframes to push the user interface development process.
